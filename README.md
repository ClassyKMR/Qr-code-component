# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

This is my first project from Frontend Mentor.

## What I learned

In this project I learned how to properly name CSS classes using BEM convention. 

```css
.block { }
.block__text { }
.block__text--heading { }
```

Also I learned how to center divisions using Flexbox layout.

```css
html {
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
}
```

This was very basic project and I had a lot of fun during my work. In the next, more complicated projects I will extend README files.
